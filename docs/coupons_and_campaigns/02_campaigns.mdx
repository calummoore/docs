Besides running discount experiments, Corrily also supports the ability to run discount campaigns. Discount campaigns can
be used to:

* Run promotional campaigns during key marketing windows across multiple channels - such as site-wide banners, in-product
or emails
* Personalize the discounts rather than a flat X% off for everyone, based on user characteristics

Soon, we will be adding capability to render these discount strategies on site-wide banners, so you don't have to worry about building
banners and pop-ups on your own. You will not only be able to use Corrily as the backend optimization engine, but also use Corrily
to display these discounts on your web properties
