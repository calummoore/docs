Corrily Coupons can be used to apply discounts to the products and subscriptions you offer. Coupons in Corrily can be either
a fixed amount coupon such as 10 USD or 1000 JPY, or a percentage off, such as 10% or 15% off

You can use coupons to:

* Apply discounts to every invoice or only one invoice
* Reduce invoice amounts by a percentage or a flat amount
* Apply discounts to every subscription a customer has or only specific ones


<h3> Create a Corrily Coupon </h3>
