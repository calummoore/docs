A successful pricing strategy needs to look beyond a one-size fits all strategy. Corrily Audiences help you get a deeper
understand of how your user base is reacting to your current pricing, any pricing experiments or changes that you roll out.
For e.g. your link shortener subscription service may be seeing higher churn amongst the *freelancers* audience segment,
and *boutique creative studios* may have higher willingess to pay for your products.

Corrily Audiences can not only help you uncover these insights, you can also use these insights in your price segmentation
strategy.

A Corrily Audience can consist of the following:
    * *country* that the user is coming in from.
    * Any number of custom attributes. For e.g. you can create an audience called *Young students in India*, with *country=India*, and customer attributes: *Age*, and
    *User Type*

You can also create worldwide Corrily Audiences by selecting *All Countries* while creating an audience
