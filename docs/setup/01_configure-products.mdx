A Corrily product represents a sellable item, such as a subscription or a one-time purchase.[^1]

To create a product go to the `Products` tab and hit `Create Product` where you'll need to define:

* **Base price** representing the default price to display for this product in the absence of any other prices.[^2]
* **Interval** and **Interval Count** if the product represents a subscription.[^3] If it's a one-time purchase, you can set **Interval** to equal `one_time`.
* **API ID**, the unique identifier you will use to call for this product.
* Optionally, you can also associate product IDs from web or mobile payment gateways (e.g. `Stripe` or `Apple App Store`) to the Corrily product. This step is not required
and can be done later in the `Integration` tab.

Footnotes:
[^1]: At the moment Corrily does not support metred products.
[^2]: At the moment, only base prices in `USD` are allowed. We plan to support other base currencies soon. You can still set prices in other currencies when localizing currencies.
[^3]: `Interval` can be one of `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year`. The `Interval Count` represents the number of periods of
`Interval` that need to pass before the product is charged for again.
