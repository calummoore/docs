Product prices can be further specified in the dashboard's Pricing Control Centre which a tabular view of all prices.

When setting prices, Corrily follows a hierarchy of precedence, as seen in the image below. Country prices take precedence
over product base prices. If a user a product price is being fetched for belong to an audience that has a price, then
 that audience's price will take precedence over a country price tied to where the user is from. Finally, experimental
 prices take precedence over all other prices apart from direct price overrides.
