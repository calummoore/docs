Product prices can be further specified in the dashboard's **Pricing Control Centre** which a tabular view of all prices.

When setting prices, Corrily follows a hierarchy of precedence, as seen in the image below. Country prices take precedence
over product base prices. If a user a product price is being fetched for belong to an audience that has a price, then
that audience's price will take precedence over a country price tied to where the user is from. Finally, experimental
prices take precedence over all other prices apart from direct price overrides.

### Locking prices to users

When products are requests for users using the [prices endpoint](api-reference/calculate-price) the returned prices are
locked-in by Corrily and all subsequent calls (unless overriden) will return the same prices.

[Mention IP logic]

### Other actions that impact price

Additionally, other actions might affect the price fetched. These include coupon applications, which take either a fixed amount or a
percentage off a price; rounding rules, which shift prices to look nice; or requests for a locked price to be displayed
in another currency.
