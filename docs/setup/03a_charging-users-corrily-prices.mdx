Corrily has the ability to return all sorts of prices. These might be specific to a country, or an audience, or they could
be an experimental price. Regardless, the universe of possible Corrily prices is often greater than the base product or plan prices
you have set in your payment gateway. Below are the ways we suggest you accommodate this in both **web** and **mobile**.

### Web

When integrating with web payment gateways or subscription management services the Corrily proposed price can be passed as
a price override. Users are still subscribed to the same plan or purchase the same product, but with a custom price different
to the gateway-defined base price.

Corrily provides the exact amounts and currencies you should charge in its [integration objects](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/calculate-price#body-params) field.

You can read more about how price overrides work in different platforms:
- Stripe (via [payment intents](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents#best-practices),
[subscription creation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-items-data-price-custom_unit_amount),
or [checkout sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data-unit_amount)
