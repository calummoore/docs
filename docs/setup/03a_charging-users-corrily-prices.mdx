Corrily has the ability to return all sorts of prices. These might be specific to a country, or an audience, or they could
be an experimental price. Regardless, the universe of possible Corrily prices is often greater than the base product or plan prices
you have set in your payment gateway. Below are the ways we suggest you accommodate this in both **web** and **mobile**.

### Web

When integrating with web payment gateways or subscription management services the Corrily proposed price can be passed as
a price override. Users are still subscribed to the same plan or purchase the same product, but with a custom price different
to the gateway-defined base price.

Corrily provides the exact amounts and currencies you should charge in the `product.integrations` field of its [response](api-reference/calculate-price#response).

You can read more about how price overrides work in different services:

[subscription creation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-items-data-price-custom_unit_amount),
or [checkout sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data-unit_amount)

### Mobile

Charging prices on mobile is different from the web in that mobile prices (in-app products in both Google and Apple) cannot be overriden. A mobile in-app purchase
product has a fixed price (or fixed set of prices across countries) that cannot be easily changed. As a result, to be able
to charge audience or experimental prices on mobile, new products at different price points need to be introduced.

As an example say you hand a monthly product `monthly` and wanted to charge students at half the price you charge normal
users as well as run an experiment to see whether your baseline `monthly` products works best at the current price, half the price,
or 1.5x the price. In that case you would need to create two additional products `monthly_0.5` and `monthly_1.5`. You could
then rely on Corrily's segmentation logic to show select groups, such as the students, the `monthly_0.5` price and on Corrily's
experimentation logic to study whether `monthly_0.5`, `monthly`, or `monthly_1.5` price points work best.
