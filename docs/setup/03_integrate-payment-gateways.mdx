This guide explains how to get a Corrily API key and product IDs.

<Info>

<h3>You might already have an API key</h3>

If you have already had a Corrily [demo](https://calendly.com/corrily/demo-call?month=2021-08) we have probably already set up an API key and list of products for you (based on what we've seen on your pricing page). Email [api@corrily.com](mailto:api@corrily.com) to check if we already have an API key and product ID(s) for you.

## Prepare your product information

Gather the following information about your product/service:

- **Product name**: A human-readable, descriptive name for the product/service
- **Base price (USD)**: The default price of your product/service
- **Recurrence interval**: How frequently the product/service is charged (e.g. `Month`, `Year`, or `One-Off`)
- **API ID**: The identifier that you'll provide when calling Corrily's REST API endpoints
- **Cents**: Whether you display your price with cents or not (e.g. $20 or $19.99)

If you have a subscription service with multiple billing plans, you should provide this information for each billing plan.

Example:

| Product/Service Name | Base Price (USD) | Recurrence Interval | API ID        | Cents |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Monthly Plan         | 10               | Month               | monthly_plan  | True  |
| Annual Plan          | 60               | Year                | annual_plan   | True  |
| Lifetime Plan        | 600              | One-Off             | lifetime_plan | False |

## Email Corrily

Email [api@corrily.com](mailto:api@corrily.com) the product information that you prepared in the previous section. The Corrily team will reply with your API key and product ID(s).

## Notify Corrily of payment gateway events

As explained in [Price optimization overview](../pricing/price-optimization-overview), Corrily needs to be notified of subscription and charge events if you're doing price experimentation. The easiest way is through OAuth and just requires 2 clicks. After access is granted, your payment gateway automatically notifies Corrily of subscription and charge events. Otherwise you can [manually notify Corrily](../payment-gateways/integration-guide#manually-notify-corrily-of-subscription-and-charge-events).

If you're using Stripe and would like to get your Corrily integration started now, click the **Connect with Stripe** button to grant Corrily read-only access to your Stripe subscription and charge events.
