description: "Integrating payment gateways and subscription management services to receive revenue events."

For Corrily to run experiments and serve analytics it needs to receive information about **revenue events** these in include: charge events and, in the case of
subscription products, subscription events too.

There two ways to go about this:
- **Via webhook**: where your payment gateway or subscription management service sends event data directly
to Corrily's servers that parse it and join in to the user-level features, prices, and other metadata collected through
Corrily's APIs. Supported services include:
    - Stripe
    - Recurly
    - Chargebee
    - Braintree
    - Adyen
- Through the **custom integration API**: where you send key revenue events to our custom integration endpoints.
