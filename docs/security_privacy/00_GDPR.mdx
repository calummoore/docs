Corrily only collects and stores information that is necessary to offer our service, and we only do this with the consent of
our customers. Our approach towards privacy, security, and data protection align with the core tenets of GDPR.

Corrily takes Data Protection seriously - we have completed a comprehensive review of our operations to ensure that
we are able to meet our obligations under all applicable regulations in all territories. We have **completed a GDPR
implementation** project to ensure we have all required policies and procedures in place, and that we respect the rights
of our data subjects at all times. We have documented policies and procedures covering all aspects of compliance including:
Privacy Policy, SAR Policy, Data Breach Policy, Information Security Policy and have adopted the GDPR DPA document as
standard.

Additionally, we have appointed an **Article 27 Representative** and have established relationships with data protection
consultants to ensure we meet our ongoing obligations and operate to the highest level of compliance at all times.
