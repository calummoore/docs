A list of one or more of the below integration price objects. Not required in the case of a custom integration using the
[Subscription](../api-reference/create-subscription) and
[Charge](../api-reference/create-subscription) endpoints where Corrily product IDs are passed to alert us of
payment gateway revenue activity.

<Expandable title="<stripe>">
    <ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
        Should be set to equal `stripe`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="stripe_product_id" type="float" required>
        The matching [Stripe product ID](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products/object#product_object-id).
    </ResponseField>

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="<stripe_with_interval>">
    <ResponseField name="type" type="stripe_with_interval" required>
        Should be set to equal `stripe_with_interval`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="stripe_product_id" type="float" required>
        The matching [Stripe product ID](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products/object#product_object-id).

        Sometimes Stripe products actually encompass more than what Corrily would consider a product. For example,
        the Stripe product for a company's "Pro Plan" might have two
        [Price objects](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/object)
        one for the monthly version of the plan, the other for its annual version. Meanwhile, Corrily would consider
        these to be two distinct products `pro_monthly` and `pro_annual`. To capture such differences you can pass
        a `stripe_with_interval` integration object which can help separate such cases.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="interval_count" type="float" required>
        The number of intervals (specified in the interval attribute) between subscription billings.
        For example, interval=month and interval_count=3 bills every 3 months.
    </ResponseField>
