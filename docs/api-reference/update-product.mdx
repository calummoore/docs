Sometimes Stripe products actually encompass more than what Corrily would consider a product. For example,
the Stripe product for a company's "Pro Plan" might have two
[Price objects](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/object)
one for the monthly version of the plan, the other for its annual version. Meanwhile, Corrily would consider
these to be two distinct products `pro_monthly` and `pro_annual`. To capture such differences you can pass
a `stripe_with_interval` integration object which can help separate such cases.

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="interval_count" type="integer" required>

The number of intervals (specified in the interval attribute) between subscription billings.
For example, interval=month and interval_count=3 bills every 3 months.
