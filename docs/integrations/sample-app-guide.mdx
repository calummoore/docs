This guide walks you through how we created the Corrily sample app in Node.js. The sample app demonstrates how to:

- Use Corrily's [Calculate price](../api-reference/calculate-price) API to present optimal prices to visitors based on their location
- Charge custom subscription prices in Stripe Checkout
- Notify Corrily of subscription and invoice events so that it can determine if the prices that it's presenting to your users are optimal

Here's a [live demo](https://corrily.glitch.me/) of the sample app and the full [source code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/corrily). The recipe at the bottom of this page provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how the sample app's code works.

## Set up your Stripe account

Here is how we set up our Stripe account when creating the demo:

1. Sign up for a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account.
1. Log in to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com).
1. Open the **Products** page of the Stripe Dashboard.
1. Click **Add product**.
1. Enter `Corrily` for the product's **Name**.
1. Under **Price information** set **Price** to `10`.
1. Keep the default values for the rest of the
   fields (**Pricing model**: `Standard pricing`, `Recurring`, **Billing period**: `Monthly`, **Usage is metered**: disabled).
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Add another price**.
1. Set **Price** to `100` (`USD`).
1. Set **Billing period** to `Yearly`.
1. Leave the rest of the values the same as before.
1. Click **Save product**. Stripe takes you to the **Overview** page for your new product.
1. Under the **Details** section note your product **ID**. It should look similar to this: `prod_XXXXXXXXXX`
1. Under the **Pricing** section note your **API ID** values. You should have one for your monthly pricing option and another one for your yearly pricing option. They should look like this: `price_XXXXXXXXXX`
