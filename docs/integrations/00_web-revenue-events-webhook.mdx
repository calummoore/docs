Integrating Corrily via webhook is the simplest way to let Corrily know about revenue events which we need to run experiments
and analytics.

To integrate via webhook, simply go to the dashboard and click on `Integrations`, then select the gateway you wish to integrate
and copy the Corrily-provided webhook url to your payment gateway. Stripe is even easier, and can be integrated using an OAuth flow
which establishes the webhook connections through a Stripe Connect flow.
