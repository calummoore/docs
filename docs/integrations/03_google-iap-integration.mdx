Corrily needs a way of detecting revenue events coming in from various in-app purchase types. In each case Corrily needs
to be informed of any charge and subscription events relating to products being experimented on.

### Using Corrily's custom integration endpoints

If you already have a central location that handles subscriptions and charge events you can let Corrily know about them
using our [Custom Integration Guide](integrations/01_custom-integration).

### Letting Corrily handle server-to-server events

Alternatively, you can point link your [Google Play Store real-time developer notifications](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev0067a330b) with Corrily
and let us handle Play Store revenue events for you.

However, you will have to call our identify endpoint and pass us a `purchaseToken` on product purchase from within
the application so we can correctly tie the user to the Play Store notifications.
