Corrily needs a way of detecting revenue events coming in from various in-app purchase types (consumables, non-consumables,
auto-renewable subscriptions, or non-renewing subscriptions). In each case Corrily needs to be informed of any charge
and subscription events relating to products being experimented on.

### Using Corrily's custom integration endpoints

If you already have a central location that handles subscriptions and charge events you can let Corrily know about them
using our [Custom Integration Guide](integrations/01_custom-integration).

### Let Corrily handle server-to-server events

Alternatively, you can point your [App Store Server Notifications](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev0067a330b) to Corrily's
endpoint [and let Corrily handle](integrations/00_revenue-events-webhook) App Store revenue events for you.

However, you will have to call our identify endpoint and pass us a `original_transaction_id` on product purchase from within
the application so we can correctly tie the user to the App Store notifications.
