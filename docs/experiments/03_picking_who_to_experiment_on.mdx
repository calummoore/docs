<h3> From Hypothesis to Experiment Design </h3>
Before running an experiment, it is important to **outline what hypothesis you want to test**. This could mean running a single experiment
or it could mean breaking down the hypothesis into multiple experiments. For e.g. if your hypothesis is that there may be **higher willingness
to pay for your products in North America**, you may want to break down the hypothesis into two experiments - one experiment across
US and Canada (since they are likely similar markets for your business), and another for Mexico.

If your hypothesis is a little more specific - say, there is higher willingness to pay amongst *professionals in North America*,
it is best to **define the relevant audience** on the Corrily dashboard, and segment your experiment further.

Other important consideration when designing your experiment is to think through **what user cohorts do you want to experiment on**.
Do you want to experiment on solely on new users who have never seen your pricing page before, or you want to experiment with just
the free user base.

There are all important considerations in deciding who to experiment on and setting your experiments up for success.
