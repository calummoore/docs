<h3> Why use Corrily for your pricing, packaging and discount experiments?</h3>

Corrily provides an end to end experimentation platform for all things pricing, packaging,  discounts and promotions.
Corrily's experimentation platform abstracts the complexity involved in running experiments in-house, and manages
everything for you. Moreover, our **machine learning models are pre-trained, and continuously improving** over time based
on your business-specific data and anonymous data across our entire customer base. This, in combination with our
**data-efficient sampling algorithms**, results in **30-40% improvement** in experiment convergence over traditional AB/n
experiments.

<h3> What can you manage using Corrily's experimentation platform? </h3>

Experiments in Corrily can be set-up and managed using our dashboard or the API:

* Defining the experiment objective
* Managing control and experiment treatments
* Orchestrating experiments i.e. traffic allocation, adding and disabling particular experiment treatments
* Measuring experiment results across most common metrics such as ARPU, LTV, Conversion, Retention, MRR, ARR etc.
* Calculating statistical significance and Confidence Intervals
* Post-experiment clean-up
* Rolling out winning experiment treatments

<h3> Different types of Experiments in Corrily </h3>

Corrily's Experimentation platform allows you to run various kinds of experiments.

* **Pricing Experiments:** to find the best price for a set of users. Pricing experiments can be used to test different price
points, different strikethrough prices, as well as price formatting i.e. price rounding strategies and currencies shown
* **Packaging Experiment:** to find the best combination of products and plans for a set of users. Packaging experiments
can also be used to test things such as copy variations for a product, different trial length etc.
* **Discount Experiments:** to find the optimal discount for a set of users. Discount experiments can be used to test optimal
discount percentages or amounts  or coupons

<h3> Things to know before setting up an experiment </h3>

A few things to note while running an experiment with Corrily:
* **Experiment Objective:** Corrily supports various experiment objectives that you can choose from, such as
Optimizing ARPU, LTV, Conversion or Retention.Make sure you are selecting right experiment objective
* **Experiment Targeting:** Experiments can be run on a subset of products, countries and audiences. We recommend spending
some time thinking through the experiment architecture, especially if you plan on running multiple experiments. At Corrily, our
pricing and Data Science experts are more than happy to consult.
* **Experiment States:** An experiment can have multiple states: `Draft`, `Ongoing`, `In Review`,`Paused` `Completed`. You can
set-up an experiment in the `Draft` state, submit it for `Review` before going live. Once an experiment is live, you can decide
to `Pause` an experiment (say during critical business periods), and `Resume` it later. Experiments can move to a `Completed`
state when they reach desired statistical significance, or can be forced to end subjectively
* **Traffic Allocation:** Experiment traffic allocation can be manual or dynamic i.e. optimized automatically by Corrily's machine
learning models
* An experiment in Corrily does not necessarily need to have a control group
