<h3> Why use Corrily for your pricing, packaging and discount experiments?</h3>

Corrily provides an end to end experimentation platform for all things pricing, packaging,  discounts and promotions.
Corrily's experimentation platform abstracts the complexity involved in running experiments in-house, and manages
everything for you. Moreover, our machine learning models are pre-trained, and continuously improving over time based
on your business-specific data and anonymous data across our entire customer base. This, in combination with our
data-efficient sampling algorithms results in 30-40% improvement in experiment convergence over traditional AB/n experiments.

Experiments in Corrily can be set-up and managed using our dashboard or the API:

* Defining the experiment objective
* Managing control and experiment treatments
* Orchestrating experiments i.e. traffic allocation, adding and disabling particular experiment treatments
* Measuring experiment results across most common metrics such as ARPU, LTV, Conversion, Retention, MRR, ARR etc.
* Calculating statistical significance and Confidence Intervals.
* Post-experiment clean-up
* Rolling out winning experiment treatments.


Corrily's Experimentation platform allows you to run various kinds of experiments.

<h3> Experiment Types in Corrily </h3>

* **Pricing Experiments:** to find the best price for a set of users. Pricing experiments can be used to test different price
points, different strikethrough prices, as well as price formatting i.e. price rounding strategies and currencies shown
* **Packaging Experiment:** to find the best combination of products and plans for a set of users. Packaging experiments
can also be used to test things such as copy variations for a product, different trial length etc.
* **Discount Experiments:** to find the optimal discount for a set of users. Discount experiments can be used to test optimal
discount percentages or amounts  or coupons

A few things to note while running an experiment with Corrily:

* **Experiment Objective:** Corrily supports various experiment objectives that you can choose from, such as
Optimizing ARPU, LTV, Conversion or Retention
* **Experiment Targeting:** Experiments can be run on a subset of products, countries and audiences
* **Experiment States:** An experiment can have multiple states: `Draft`, `Ongoing`, `In Review`,`Paused` `Completed`
* **Traffic Allocation:** Experiment traffic allocation can be manual or dynamic i.e. optimized automatically by Corrily
* An experiment in Corrily does not necessarily need to have a control group
