**Corrily's packaging experiments** allow you to test various packaging strategies for your entire user base or a subset
of users to test what combination of products and plans work best for you them. You can use a packaging experiment to test:

* Different combination of plans for e.g. say you have 4 tiers of your product offering - `Basic, Pro, Team, Advanced`.
A packaging experiment allows you to test showing different combination of those plans to different users (including targeted segments),
and decide what's the optimal combination
* A packaging experiment also allows you to test different copies, feature highlights etc. by creating different variants
of the same plans say `Basic VariantA` v/s `Basic VariantB`

<h3> How to run a packaging experiment?</h3>

* To set up a packaging experiment, you need to select the the **experiment objective**
* Define the packages:
    * Select which products or plans go into which packages
    * If you have an existing packaging strategy, that variant forms your `control group`
* Define which **countries or audiences** should be included in the experiment i.e. who is part of the experiment
* *Select the **traffic allocation** strategy i.e. decide whether you want to manually set traffic allocation across each
    experiment treatment, or let Corrily automatically manage traffic allocation*
* Provide additional information such as **historical churn data** for your individual products
* Once an experiment is set up, you can `Submit for Review`
* Corrily's experimentation team reviews and takes the experiment Live
