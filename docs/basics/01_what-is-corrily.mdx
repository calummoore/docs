Today, digital businesses leave both money and users on the table today owing to various challenges with their
pricing and packaging challenges such as:

* Slow and expensive price discovery
* Lack of willingness to pay across different markets and user segments
* Lack of resources when it comes to experimenting with pricing and packaging
* Inability to change prices without complex engineering

**Corrily** solves these challenges by removing the complexity and ambiguity around price discovery, experimentation and
price management behind a simple-to-use service. Corrily's platform allows you to:

* **Run live experiments**
    * **Price Experiments** to test what prices optimize your revenue and conversion. Pricing tests can span simple
    tests such as testing individual prices or currencies of products, or more complex tests such as relative pricing of
    products
    * **Packaging Experiments** to test what combination of products work the best - for e.g. for an e-learning businesses
    students are more likely to buy short term plans such as a month plan, whereas professionals may be inclined to
    buy longer term plans such as 3 months, or even an annual plan
    * **Discount Experiments** to test what discounts work the best for your objectives i.e. does 10% discount off work
    better than a flat $10 discount

* **Understand Price Elasticity**
    * Detailed reports and analytics to help to understand your product's demand curve
    * Monitor key downstream metrics such as revenue, ARPU, Trial and Paid Conversion, LTV, Average Order Value (AOV) etc.

* **Offer Personalized Discounts**
    *Personalize discounts for every user based on user features such as their location, device type, acquisition channel,
    product engagement etc.
    *Run promotional campaigns such as during holiday periods or during other key marketing moments
