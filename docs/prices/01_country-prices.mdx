You can use Corrily to set prices in specific countries. As an example, let's say we wish to serve a local price for
user coming in from Japan (`JP`). This can be done by going to the **Price Control Centre** and setting local prices for
products in Japanese Yen (`JPY`)


### How Corrily decides where a user is from
When calling Corrily's API you can either:
* Pass an explicit two-letter country code to the `country` parameter.
* Pass an IPv4/6 address to the `ip` parameter which Corrily resolves to the correct country.
* Pass a `get_ip_from_request:true` parameter which lets Corrily know to find the IP address in the `X-Forwarded-For` header field.
