### Applying rounding to base prices to quickly populate country prices

Rounding can be applied on the dashboard when populating country prices. If you know the base price of a product and want
to quickly localise its price, in local currencies, across different countries you'll need to decide how best local prices
should be rounded. These "bulk" actions can be launched in the Pricing Control Centre section of the dashboard and generally
follow the same rules as the rounding strategies described in the below section.


### Applying rounding strategies to ephemeral prices

[Ephemeral prices](prices/04_ephemeral-prices) are often not well rounded, and need to have rounding applied to them.
For example, a monthly product selling at `9.99` will be priced at `7.4925` after a 25% coupon application. To bring
this price back to looking nice a rounding strategy can be applied to shift it to a nice number like `7.49` or `7.50`.

The rounding strategies Corrily supports are governed by a simple language which is best described through example.
Imagine you want to round up to `.25`, `.49`, `.75` or `.99` for prices between 0 and anything less than 100 and for
anything equal to 100 or more you want to round to the nearest multiple of 50. A rounding rule to define this would then
be:

- `0_<100:f25_f49_f75_f99_nearest|>=100_inf:multiple_50_up`

Notice how the rule is split into segments delimited by `|` each of which contains a range `0_<100` and `>=100_inf` followed by
`:` and a **range body** which can either be:
- a sequence of numbers to round to (`f25_f49_f75_f99` where `f` denotes a float, i.e. the ability to round to say `4.59`)
- a function such as `multiple_50` (the other important function is `sigfig_<n_sigfigs>` which rounds to the nearest number of
significant figures.

Finally, each range body must end with either `_down`, `_up` or `_nearest` which defined whether numbers are rounder down, up or to the nearest number defined in the **range body**.
