If you are billing users in multiple currencies, FX rates are critical since they can affect the revenue collected. Let's say
your base currency is `USD` and you display and charge users in Europe in `Euro`. With Corrily, you can either use
`Fixed FX rates` or `Floating FX rates` to arrive at the final display price. When using `Floating FX rates`, Corrily
also let's you decide the frequency at which you want to update the FX rates.

To give an **illustrative example**, let's say the price of a product is **100 USD** (your base currency) and you were simply
doing currency conversion to arrive at the corresponding price in Euro(without doing any purchasing power parity adjustments).
If you fixed your `USD-EUR` currency pair FX rate (at **0.87** on Jan 1, 2022), you would have fixed your price at 87 Euros in Europe.
On Oct 31, 2022, that would have meant you recognized **86.5 USD** in revenue for a new purchase of the product.
That's a 12.5% hit on your revenue. Corrily helps you monitor and adjust your prices in local countries based on FX movements.
