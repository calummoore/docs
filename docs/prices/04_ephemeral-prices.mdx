description: "The concept of ephemeral prices in Corrily."

Corrily price can be either **fixed** or **ephemeral**.

### Fixed Prices
A fixed price is a set *\<amount, currency\>* pair that is set
via the dashboard, or one of our CRUD API endpoints, and identifiable by a *price_id* prefixed by `price_<id>`. The amount set will match exactly the
display values returned by Corrily's API.

### Ephemeral Prices
Ephemeral prices are the product of price transformations applied to fixed prices such as explicit applications of
rounding, calls for the price to be displayed in another currency, coupon applications, or price overrides.
Ephemeral prices too are identifiable by price IDs but these are prefixed by `eph_price_<id>`.
